# FDF
The project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a
3D land-scape by linking various points.  
## Details
The coordinates (x, y, z) of the landscape are stored in a .fdf file passed as a parameter to
your program.

Here is an example of input file:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/054477f6-d381-4d2f-a228-506ac17c8980" width="700">

Each number represents a point in space:
- The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.
- The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.
- The value corresponds to its altitude.

Executing program using the example file should render a landscape similar to:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74156c2e-d153-45f0-bb7d-08ef05b535b4" width="700">

Program displays the image in a window, and management of the window should remain smooth 
(changing to another window, minimizing, and so forth).

Pressing ESC or clicking on the cross on the windowâ€™s frame closes the window and quits
the program in a clean way.

FDF uses the images of the MLX42 library (https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42),
which provides primitive tools to draw textures onto the window.
